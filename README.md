a threejs card trick, with a dead simple way of guessing any chosen card

To be honest I'm not sure if this will work out of the box, but I presume it will!
Good luck if you make use of this, or if nobody even opens this repo; oh well :)

## How to dazzle a crowd (with help of a friend)

Start the main server.js file with node
Navigate on a computer (in my case when I used this a class room smart board) to the root
Have a friend in the room, who is really sneaky like, have the page /otto/ open (named after who helped me out with my trick) on their device

Give someone a deck of cards, tell them to shuffle it however they like, and then show the audience (maybe even hide in the other room while they do)

Let them answer the questions that pop up on the screen (as of right now customized for usage in my current drama class, so you might want to modify questions.js within the static folder to your liking)

Your friend, once he taps the 'send' (or whatever its spelt I forget and I'm too lazy to open up the source) it will glitch itself to the front-center of the screen.

You get 100 for your magic trick and nobody really knows how you pulled it off

(at least that how it worked 4 meeeeeeee)
