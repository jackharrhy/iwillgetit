A ThreeJS card trick; with a dead simple way of guessing any chosen card.

### How to dazzle a crowd (with help of a friend)

Start the main server.js file with node.

Navigate to a root of said server.

Have a sneaky friend in the room, and have the page /thetrick/ open on their device.

Give anyone who isn't in on it a deck of cards.

Tell them to shuffle it however they like, and then show the audience the 'random card'.

(Maybe even hide in the other room while they do)

Let them answer the questions that pop up on the screen; it is recommended that you skim through tge selection of questions before doing it yourself to make it a bit more obvious to the crowd.

Once your sneaky friend presses the button, it will 'glitch', the selected card to the front-center of the screen.

You get 100 for your magic trick and nobody really knows how you pulled it off.

*(at least that how it worked for me)*
