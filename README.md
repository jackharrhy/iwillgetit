A ThreeJS card trick, with a dead simple way of guessing any chosen card

## How to dazzle a crowd (with help of a friend)

Start the main server.js file with node
Navigate on a computer (in my case when I used this a class room smart board) to the root
Have a sneaky friend in the room, have the page /thetrick/ open on their device

Give someone a deck of cards, tell them to shuffle it however they like, and then show the audience; maybe even hide in the other room while they do

Let them answer the questions that pop up on the screen; it is recommended that you skim through my selection of questions before doing it yourself to make it a bit more relevant to your crowd

Once your sneaky friend presses the button, it will glitch the selected card to the front-center of the screen

You get 100 for your magic trick and nobody really knows how you pulled it off

*(at least that how it worked for me)*
